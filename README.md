Project Overview
This project is a computer-vision prototype designed to identify and classify raw materials used in concrete mixing. It utilizes the YOLOv11 object detection architecture to recognize materials, overlaying bounding boxes and class labels with dynamic coloring. The entire training and inference pipeline is documented and executed within a Jupyter Notebook.

Objectives
Real-time Inference: Run efficiently on a standard laptop CPU.

Material Classification: Identify Cement Bags, Gravel, Sand, and Unknown/Mixed objects.

Robustness: Handle variations in lighting and material texture.
